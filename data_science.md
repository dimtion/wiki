## K-means clustering

K-means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that partition a set of
observiations in k clusters.

### Description

From wikipedia:

> Given a set of observations $`(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)`$ where each
> observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to
> partition the n observations into k sets $`S = {S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k}`$ so
> as to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares:
> ```math
> \arg_{S} \min \sum_{i=1}^{k}
> ```
